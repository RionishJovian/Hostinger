 * Shop-floor operator permissions granted from Users, same pattern as portal

 * site_manager get role defaults plus per-user extras (adds, never subtracts).
 *
 * Vouchers, portal deploy, and own-router configuration are always on for every
 * active role. Pending / expired accounts are still blocked by requireNotExpired
 * on writes. High-impact operations such as reboot and Multi-WAN remain grant-gated.
 * Terminal, raw REST, real test lab, MCP, Users, backups, audit, scripts,
 * credit usage, i18n and device-quota approval stay primary-user only.
