/**
 * Users page — Primary (Application owner) vs Developer capabilities.
 * Keep UI gates and server checks aligned with this matrix.
 *
 * Who is who:
 * - User: café shop owner managing their own RouterBOARD Hotspot business; direct
 *   parentage is shown separately from operational ownership.
 * - Primary: Application owner / producer — does not own a café; one per cloud.
 * - Developer: builds app features — does not own a café; ranks above Primary.
 * - Verified Agent: hired by the Application owner to recruit café Users; Magic Coins
 *   commission on monthly/annual purchases from Users tagged under their agent id.
 *
 * Ownership model:
 * - User / Agent own themselves (isolated routers, plans, portal).
 * - One Primary per cloud; Developer ranks above Primary and scopes platform-wide.
 * - Verified Agent referrals tag new Users under the agent for Magic Coins only.
